## Features

- User registration and authentication using JWT.
- CRUD operations for Users, Projects, Tasks, and Comments.
- Nested routing for Projects, Tasks, and Comments.
- Permissions and authentication checks.
- API documentation using Swagger (drf-yasg).

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- Git (to clone the repository)
- SQLite (default database, no setup required)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akkiwadhwa/management_application.git
cd management_application
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary packages manually:

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt drf-yasg drf-nested-routers django-filter
```

## Database Migrations

Apply the migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## Running the Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

---

## API Documentation

You can access the interactive API documentation generated by Swagger at:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)
- **ReDoc UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/)

These interfaces allow you to explore the API endpoints, view request and response schemas, and make test requests.

## Usage

### Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. You need to obtain a token by logging in and include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

#### 1. Register a New User

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/users/register/`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "email": "your_email@example.com",
  "password": "your_password",
  "first_name": "YourFirstName",
  "last_name": "YourLastName"
}
```

#### 2. Obtain a JWT Token

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/users/login/`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "refresh": "your_refresh_token",
  "access": "your_access_token"
}
```

#### 3. Use the Access Token

Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like:

- **Swagger UI:** Interactive testing via the web interface.
- **cURL:** Command-line tool for sending HTTP requests.
- **Postman:** GUI application for testing APIs.

### Example: Creating a Project via API

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/projects/`

**Headers:**

```
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "name": "Project Alpha",
  "description": "Description of Project Alpha"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Project Alpha",
  "description": "Description of Project Alpha",
  "owner": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "your_username",
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "first_name": "YourFirstName",
    "last_name": "YourLastName",
    "date_joined": "2024-10-25T12:00:00Z"

## Additional Configuration

### Setting Up Admin User

To create a superuser for accessing the Django admin site:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Provide the username, email, and password when prompted.

### Accessing the Admin Site

Start the development server and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

Log in with your superuser credentials.

### Installing Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt` file, ensure it includes:

```
Django>=3.0,<4.0
djangorestframework
djangorestframework-simplejwt
drf-yasg
drf-nested-routers
django-filter
```

Install using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Import Errors

- Ensure all necessary packages are installed.
- Check for typos in import statements.

### 2. Authentication Errors

- Verify that you're including the JWT access token in the `Authorization` header.
- Tokens expire; use the refresh token to obtain a new access token if needed.

### 3. Migration Errors

- Delete existing migration files and database if necessary.
- Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` again.
